Mayor Sims was reluctant to allow the system to come to fruition as he (and others) had become suspicious of Mayor Farley's death. He believed that without knowing more precisely what would happen to the cell wall at fruition, it was ill-advised to allow it to possibly "open" -- thus allowing what might be outside - in, and what might be inside - out.<br /></span><span class="d" i="3">The system has the capacity to throttle all four connected worlds. The idea, as you are well aware, is to suppress the ecosystem power and thus inhibit full maturity of the Trees. It was postulated (and since became apparent) that this suppression will keep whatever unknown "maturity" process from happening -- and grant us direct control over Tree fruition.<br /><br /></span><span class="d" i="4">1 / 2</span><span class="d" i="5">Regards,<br /><br />C.W.<br /></span></p><p i="5" name="Bleeder_b" child="6"><span class="d" i="0">The rate of dissipation is sensed and regulated automatically. The power is collected through Villein engineered extruded cables that attached directly to the dome membrane. When the maximum power level is exceeded, the dissipation phase is triggered, creating an electrical charge followed by a discharge into the water. Through electrolysis an amount of hydrogen and oxygen is generated. We capture some of these elements for our own use, but the great majority is released into our atmosphere. This gassing might be a cause for concern were it not for the ecosystem's ability to filter and maintain our atmosphere at near ideal levels.

But when we suddenly find ourselves among other intelligent species who don't share our culture, history, DNA, or vocal chords, it requires a huge amount of effort for the beginning of rudimentary chatting. This quick overview will set the stage for what to expect when communicating with our neighbors.</span><span class="d" i="2"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_a.png" /></span><span class="d" i="3">Mofang</span><span class="d" i="4">The Mofang were the first non-humans we met. With at least some level of similar physical vocal generating abilities, they picked up human words quickly. This early mimicry resulted in what the species became to be called. Even though they were able to mimic single words and simple phrases, it became evident over the years that huge grammatical differences were not easily overcome. Some have proposed that the difficulty may have arisen because the Mofang insisted on attempting to learn every human language, and as a result were never able to lock onto any consistent grammatical structure. Nevertheless, in spite of the rudimentary sentence construction, it has been very easy to communicate, and it has been unnecessary for us to learn their language beyond a few simple phrases and proper names. </span><span class="d" i="5">(If you'd like to learn more about communication with the Mofang, please contact Tam.)</span><span class="d" i="6"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_b.png" /></span><span class="d" i="7">Villein</span><span class="d" i="8">The Villein have presented a particular communication challenge. From what we can gather, they produce sounds using two large reed-like structures inside opposite sides of their heads. The vibrations generated are channeled to resonance chambers in their skulls where they are combined into a complex, low frequency, dual tone. The low frequency, bi-tonal sounds are not only hard for humans to hear and resolve, but impossible for us to mimic. And the Villeins' hearing is also oriented toward low frequency, so they are unable to hear most of the sounds associated with human speech. Therefore, communication with the Villein has relied on technology. They have adapted consoles (which the Villein fluently control with vocalization) for use by other species. Over the years, some individuals of other species (including a few humans) have learned to communicate very effectively using this method. Humans have been able to pick out </span><span class="d" i="9"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_c.png" /></span><span class="d" i="10">some higher frequency characteristics of certain key Villein words over the years. And although we can't speak to them in a way that the Villeins can understand, we are occasionally able to hear and recognize these words when spoken distinctly by the Villein.</span><span class="d" i="11">(If you'd like to learn more about communication with the Villein, please contact Vito.)</span><span class="d" i="12"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_a.png" /></span><span class="d" i="13">Arai</span><span class="d" i="14">None of the stages of the Arai morphology have any vocalization apparatus. Because of the obvious synchronization of the "barnacle" flash and the ability of the "pawns" to provide for and address the needs of the Polyarchs, it was assumed that the species could communicate  effectively. It was not until Farley began to spend large amounts of time in the Polyarch antechamber that the first clues to this communication became evident. After months of research, Farley began to have limited success with "receiving" some kind of simple "messages" that were coming from the Polyarchs. It is apparent now that the Polyarchs had been attempting to communicate the entire time, but they themselves had been experimenting with various "channels" until they finally got a response from Farley. After this breakthrough, others were able to "tune in" to the Polyarchs and learn</span><span class="d" i="15"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_b.png" /></span><span class="d" i="16">to listen. Both the Polyarchs and the pawns have a simple organ that can sense human vocal frequency, enabling them to sense simple responses from humans, but over the years, Farley was able to learn to "speak" to the Polyarchs via a related form of extrasensory transmission.</span><span class="d" i="17">(If you'd like to learn more about communication with the Arai, please contact Farley.)</span></p><p i="11" name="CWJournal" child="6"><span class="d" i="0">I ain’t lying. I been hurting a bit. Farley suggested I might write some stuff down… that it might ease the pall. She said it’s helped others. I ain’t got a lot of hope for that, but I reckon I got nothing to lose.<br />  <br />I haven’t mentioned Emma to many folks around here. And she and Scarlett have been on my mind quite a bit. I’ve got a dull ache in the back of my brain that occasionally rings back there like a broken church bell. The thought of them resonates… but, I guess what grieves me is that the ringing is quieter. I’m forgetting… losing them. It’s been a long time. <br />  <br />I saw sweet Claire playing with a truck outside Farley’s a few days ago. It brung back memories of Scarlett, but I have a hard time picturing her face anymore.<br />  <br />It’s a sad thing, losing them we love.

That’s cold comfort.<br />  <br />This writing don’t help much. It dredges the hurt up.

This place never really agreed with her. Kept to herself mostly -- depressed and downcast. Anyway, I digress. I stayed after the brief words were spoken… I was the last to leave. I wandered to the dome (as I often do) and looked out at the undulating Sorian weirdness beyond the cell wall. Movement caught my eye. Now on very rare occasions we’ve seen Mofang scrambling about in the distance, but</span><span class="d" i="3">there have been fewer and fewer sightings over the years. But before me was a tall, haggard Mofang running desperately, almost directly toward me from one of the distant structures. It (I still can’t tell the gender) got closer and closer -- I thought it would see me and stop, or turn around, or be curious about this strange dome and our world inside it...  but it continued running quickly almost directly to my position. I was frozen in place with curiosity, until my reflexes took over at the last moment, and I lept out of the way. But rather than hit the dome and fall backward, or come through into Hunrath, the dome flashed its familiar tone and the Mofang vanished. I was stunned for a bit, but I retrieved my wits and stepped into the dome</span><span class="d" i="4">myself to quickly get to the other side. After getting through I immediately turned around and saw the Mofang outside, on the other side of the dome, still running away from whatever it feared, but as if it had no sense of passing around the dome. <br /> <br />As surprising as the event was… it did serve to settle a few things in my mind. I always wondered how no one on Earth noticed what had replaced this chunk of Arizona we have here.</span><span class="d" i="5">16,772 AH<br /> <br />I've got to vent. Again, there are those who argue with me! Over and over I demonstrate that in almost every case… whatever the process was that brought</span><span class="d" i="6">us here -- it occurred at a pivotal moment. They tell their stories and they still can't admit that the abduction actually saved each of us -- all of us. What is it in human nature that grasps so strongly to the past, that we blame our saviors for stealing it from us?<br /> <br />Okay, just one more vent before bed. If each of us was individually saved from something, then maybe all of us were corporately saved from something larger. Can we really be sure what’s left?<br /> <br />And this… the arrivers come from various places AND times. Sarah got here almost 15 years ago from the year 2055, and Uzziel got here two and a half years ago from 1942! <br /><br /></span><span class="d" i="7">What does that mean? Time here is shuffled and chaotic compared to Earth. What state is Earth in right now… WHEN is Earth right now?</span><span class="d" i="8">16,787 AH<br /> <br />It's 3:15 am and I feel compelled to journal this craziness. After spending most of yesterday meditating with the Arai -- and then most of this evening discussing the nature of these worlds with CW, I had just a sip of infamous Hunrath hooch and collapsed in my chair.<br /> <br />Well, I just awoke from a dream. I'm not one who puts a lot of credibility in dreams, but maybe the Arai were able to move something in me to understand… or possibly</span><span class="d" i="9">because of the intense discussion, my subconscious mind was triggered to be able to sort out some logical connections…<br /> <br />Or maybe it was the hooch<br /> <br />The dream…<br /> <br />I was tending a garden - an immense garden. And it wasn't for food or flowers - it was just about the health of the garden. I kept working and working to control it and contain it, and make it healthier… but the garden seemed to fight me at every turn. And after what seemed like days of work I finally gave up in frustration - and as I stood there, doing nothing, the garden flourished before my eyes - growing and spreading in every direction.</span><span class="d" i="10">Because (I realized), the system that the plants were based on was not about me shaping and controlling. The natural system of plants is healthier when they are out of control - when they are free to spread, and intermingle, and cross pollinate, and mutate.<br /> <br />Now, from a human point of view, that may not provide what I want. I get smaller fruit, and smaller flowers, and untidiness. But from the point of view of the plants, they grow stronger and much more resilient and resistant.<br /> <br />The more they are scattered the higher their odds of surviving.<br /> <br />And now that I contemplate, <br /><br /></span><span class="d" i="11">I realize that even the individual plants/seeds may not appreciate the benefit of what's happening. They are torn far from their origins, forced into situations that seem extreme -- possibly even destroyed by these new environments. But for the seeds that survive…<br />ah… the seeds that survive. Now that's where real growth, strength, and abundance comes from.<br /> <br />It's so beautiful and terrifying. Beyond the beauty of it all is a system and structure that defies understanding.<br /> <br />Okay,  what if this is all a natural process. There are signs of something behind it all, but well hidden signs. So… well… if I look at all of this; the cell, <br /><br /></span><span class="d" i="12"><img src="/../Global/HighlighterLine_a.png" /></span><span class="d" i="13">the tree, the water, the seeds, the hub, the health, even the abductions… well… there seems to be a grand system -- or plan.<br /> <br />The plan doesn't take "me" into account. It is un-emotionally intent on the health of something much bigger. That may hurt my feelings, but… well…<br /> <br />what am "I" in the entire scheme of the universe.<br /> <br />I have no idea what (if anything) might have put this process into motion, but that is irrelevant.<br /> <br />Tomorrow I will talk with C.W. He could be swayed from his “battery” plan.</span><span class="d" i="14">17,145 AH<br /> <br />I really don't journal much. I came to write this down because I am distraught. As I contemplate the plan that I have set in motion, I realize that I have become the destroyer of worlds. I sat down to write… to seek some cathartic tranquilization, and I realize the last thing I journaled was some esoterically beautiful philosophy about letting this garden grow. Not so reaffirming or calming.<br /> <br />But, nevertheless, here is my reasoning, because I must write this down.<br /> <br />Simply… it's us or them.<br /> <br />Complexly… If this is some kind of garden, and we're the <br /><br /></span><span class="d" i="15">plants, or seeds, or whatever… well some of us have gotten together and decided that we're the better choice to survive… if the others have unilaterally decided that we all won't survive.<br /> <br />I AM MORE FIT, DAMN IT!<br /> <br />This is not me. I want to be calm, and garden, or un-garden, or grow, or…<br /> <br />What gives one species the right to destroy another species? Who get's to choose? Do I just lay down and die because the more aggressive species thinks they're better, more powerful? What brutal scale do I use to measure the good of some against the life of others? Does love ever destroy… in order to help more survive… to help love itself to survive?</span><span class="d" i="16">Does that even make sense?  Can I kill because I think it will bring about more love? What if I'm not even capable of understanding the situation… of hate vs. love? Maybe I am the hater? Do I generate this "love" delusion to help me maintain my sanity in light of the choice I have made?<br /> <br />My God… it's too much… if these are just my walls of delusion… then I chose to live within them.<br /> <br />I am a seed - scattered by the wind...<br /> <br />But I will not simply be trampled - I will kick and scream... and SURVIVE!<br /> <br />May God have mercy on my soul</span></p><p i="41" name="Farley_Audio_Journal" child="35"><span class="d" i="0">[click] [Farley]: Well...

Hartnell was a peaceful mining town founded by my grandfather and nestled within the red rock of the desert in the Arizona Territory. Its 163 inhabitants heard a mighty explosion on the night of June 27th, 1903. I sent several workers through the town to verify that the explosion had not caused any injuries or damage to mining equipment. They returned and reported that it must have been a loud clap of thunder caused by dry lightning for they found no damage. It was not until the light of the next morning that we were amazed to realize something profound had indeed occurred. At some point during that night, our entire mining facility, and a large circle of the land around it, seemed to have been scooped up and carried off to a completely different place - all without anyone knowing about it. </span></p><p i="49" name="HunrathHistoryScrap1b" child="1"><span class="d" i="0">The entire landscape outside of our circle of desert could only be described as alien. Large, floating rocks could be seen in the distance. No one had ever seen anything  like it, anywhere on Earth. We fully explored our new surroundings, hoping to find a way home. No way home was ever found. In fact, we soon discovered what we take for granted now - not only could we not get back home, we also could not access the landscape outside the desert. Curiously, we discovered that a flow of water was provided from a high point of rock, and we discovered a small tree growing in the very center of the circle. Our central Tree that is so important to our lives here was just a mere sapling back then.</span></p><p i="50" name="IM_EX3" child="6"><span class="d" i="0"></span><span class="d" i="1">[exasperated breathing]</span><span class="d" i="2">Perhaps...</span><span class="d" i="3">[snarls]</span><span class="d" i="4">[whimpers]</span><span class="d" i="5"></span></p><p i="51" name="IM_HU1" child="6"><span class="d" i="0"></span><span class="d" i="1">Why?</span><span class="d" i="2"></span><span class="d" i="3">Are you waiting for some purpose?</span><span class="d" i="4">I'd prefer you hurry!</span><span class="d" i="5"></span></p><p i="52" name="IM_HU2" child="6"><span class="d" i="0"></span><span class="d" i="1">I...</span><span class="d" i="2">This... desperate situation up here.</span><span class="d" i="3">If you could, please!</span><span class="d" i="4"></span><span class="d" i="5">Hurry!

11: Discussed final approval of Farley's plan with regard to the imminent attack. The full council vote was unanimous, and I gave my final approval. Preparations update -- Farley says that tunneling is almost complete.  Tham informs us that the Villeins just completed their construction and have started testing. <br /><br /></span><span class="d" i="1">17126AH - Special Council Session 12: No one attended. I will inquire as to reason for their absence.</span><span class="d" i="2">17127AH - It appears that the council members feel like we're having too many meetings. Since the plan has been approved, perhaps we can reduce our meetings to every two days for now. While I was asking Cecil about his absence I also inquired about securing the tower area.<br /></span><span class="d" i="3">17128AH - Special Council Session 13: Cecil will provide a new keycode for the lower lock in the next few days. Cecil was concerned about any survivors not having access, so it was decided that we would conceal the code in Farley's house and give the residents the location as they were being chambered. I also had him change the upper tower access code.<br /></span><span class="d" i="4">A clue to that code has been placed under the direction of our first Mayor.</span><span class="d" i="5">17129AH - I have decided to bring some of the more important mayors' logs with me for chambering. Specifically the initial Hunrath log, and then the logs that document the history of our conflict with the Mofang. I would think we would have an extra chamber available for historic documents.<br /></span><span class="d" i="6">17130AH - Special Council Session 14: Only Tham attended. He informed me that, because of the dire circumstances, the others were either extremely busy, or not inclined to have long discussion about the situation. I told him I would suspend the regular Special Council Sessions, and we would simply meet as the need arose.<br /></span><span class="d" i="7">17131AH - I paid a visit to Farley today. I asked her to check on the availability of a chamber for the documents.</span><span class="d" i="8">17135AH - I've spent the last few days collecting documents. I've divided them into two categories - Chambered and Vaulted. The Vaulted are less important, but obviously worth making an effort to save. They can be moved into Farley's vault area. The Vaulted category will also include any books that we've managed to collect through the years.<br /></span><span class="d" i="9">17137AH - With less than a week remaining before chambering begins, the population is tense. We've had several town hall meetings to try to answer any questions, but the realities of the current situation make it difficult to assuage fears.</span><span class="d" i="10">17138AH - Farley has informed me that there is one final confirmation from Chavar. If Farley doesn't hear from her by the end of 17141AH then there is no turning back. There is an odd justice to Farley's plan in that whatever the Mofang bastards send to kill us, will be returned back to them.</span><span class="d" i="11">17140AH - Special Council Session 15: A special meeting was called to go over the plans for the final time. Farley had several instruction sheets to distribute - the Mofang weapon illustration, a list of all Souls that will be used as a basis for the chambering manifest, and a thorough summary of the battle plans. These will be distributed as necessary. No word from Chavar.</span><span class="d" i="12">17141AH - Farley tells me that there will be at least one chamber available for historic documents. Any other extra chambers will be loaded with emergency provisions and medications in case either Hunrath or Maray are completely destroyed. No word from Chavar.<br /></span><span class="d" i="13">17142AH - No word from Chavar. Death is on our doorstep. Curse the Mofang devils to hell!<br /></span><span class="d" i="14">17143AH - I am leaving to be chambered. This journal will remain here - to inform any future souls of what our last days were like.</span></p><p i="79" name="Menu" child="272"><span class="d" i="0">Quit</span><span class="d" i="1">Settings</span><span class="d" i="2">Resume Game</span><span class="d" i="3">New Game</span><span class="d" i="4">Photos</span><span class="d" i="5">Load Game</span><span class="d" i="6">Continue</span><span class="d" i="7">You can only have 10 games at a time.

An Liang was the first to call the Alien a "Mofang" -- impressed with their advanced ability to imitate our sounds, movements, and mannerisms. Although they have a name for themselves, their language is mostly unpronounceable by humans. As a result, and because of their mimicry abilities, communication with the Mofang is primarily accomplished by their learning human languages rather than humans learning to speak Mofang. They have been able to learn almost every human language represented in Hunrath enough to provide functional (if rudimentary) communication.<br /></span><span class="d" i="1">The Mofang basic external morphology is remarkably humanoid -- bilateral symmetrical tetrapods, bipedal, head with anterior facial features ("mouth",</span><span class="d" i="2"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_c.png" /></span><span class="d" i="3">Species Description</span><span class="d" i="4">eyes, nostrils). Other external features include minimal body hair and raised dorsal protrusions. Constitution is somewhat frail, due apparently to their thin and lightweight internal structure, but internal investigation has not been possible. They have ample cranial space to account for a substantial brain, and their intelligence is impressive as evidenced by their advanced technology.</span><span class="d" i="5"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_a.png" /></span><span class="d" i="6"><img src="/../Global/Soarian_sketch.png" /></span><span class="d" i="7"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_c.png" /></span><span class="d" i="8">Arai<br /><br />After a certain level of maturity and health of The Tree, a passage opened at its base. This passage allowed contact with two additional species. The first contact was with the Arai. The first contact revealed the Arai to be large beetle-like insects. We were unable to communicate directly with them in any way, but they appeared to have some rudimentary level of intelligence. It was Lőrinc Tóth who first made the journey through the heart to Kaptar, and named both the new world and the inhabitants.</span><span class="d" i="9">The Arai have three distinct variants that have come to be referred to as barnacle, beetle, and polyarch. Although their morphology is dramatically different from human, their internal systems (like all of our neighbors) are supported by similar atmospheric composition and basic nutrients</span><span class="d" i="10"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_b.png" /></span><span class="d" i="11">In their barnacle stage the Arai are completely immobile. The Arai stay in this egg-like development state seemingly indefinitely. In order to hatch, they must be in proximity of a polyarch, and fertilized by the beetles after a certain stage of maturity.</span><span class="d" i="12">The beetles are the "eyes and ears, hands and feet." With only a minimal nervous system of their own, they are essentially the sensory extensions of the immobile polyarchs. They are able to execute simple commands, but apparently have very little in the way of individual sentience.</span><span class="d" i="13"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_c.png" /></span><span class="d" i="14"><img src="/../Global/Arai_sketch.png" /></span><span class="d" i="15"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_c.png" /></span><span class="d" i="16">The Arai polyarchs are the intelligence and consciousness of the species. Although it was obvious that there was intelligence behind the species, it wasn't until Caroline Farley began spending large amounts of time in close proximity that deeper communication began. With a room nearby, Farley was the first to communicate non-verbally and learn much about the species, including some historical information. The Arai species survived in their world while several other sentient species came and went. Among them an ancient species who formed a deeper relationship with the Arai, carving temples and dwellings for them in the rocks. And later, a more recent species that took over much of their homeworld. This latter species was especially adept at mechanical construction, using it mostly to capture and process large flying creatures, using the beetles as bait.</span><span class="d" i="17"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_a.png" /></span><span class="d" i="18"><img src="/../Global/Queen_sketch.png" /></span><span class="d" i="19"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_c.png" /></span><span class="d" i="20">Villein<br /><br />The final species to be discovered were the Villein. The Villein had been communicating with the Arai for many years through "ambassador" seeds, but became part of the larger community very shortly after the Arai.</span><span class="d" i="21">With a large and imposing frame, and a form of communication based on a complex, multi-voiced, low frequency, rumble, the initial introductions were intimidating. After several attempts, Amélie Vidal was able to begin some rudimentary communication and began visiting the Villein in Maray (which she named) on a regular basis. She discovered a complex and amazing society that was able to use their technology in unexpected ways. They had the ability to quickly transform their world using extruded structures based on some form of complex miniature substrate material.</span><span class="d" i="22"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_b.png" /></span><span class="d" i="23">Unlike the other worlds, the Villein sphere is scooped out of a Villein resettlement group that was preparing to set off into space to find a new homeworld. This was their way of life, to put themselves into stasis and scatter themselves through the stars.</span><span class="d" i="24">As mentioned previously, their appearance is imposing. Standing about nine feet tall, with a distinct reptilian resemblance. They have six limbs - two muscular legs and arms, and a smaller set of arms. They control every aspect of their technology with their vocalizations, but over the years they have created control panels based on their number system that allow other species to easier access elements of their technology.</span><span class="d" i="25"><img src="/../Global/Arrow_c.png" /></span><span class="d" i="26"><img src="/../Global/Villein_sketch.png" /></span></p><p i="83" name="RailMap" child="1"><span class="d" i="0"><img src="/../Global/railmap.png" /></span></p><p i="84" name="SalvagePartsLog" child="4"><span class="d" i="0">Submarine Parts <br />   Salvage Log<br /></span><span class="d" i="1"> 4 fluid valves and pipe<br />    attachment<br /> 6 fire hoses<br />  1 large fluid valve<br /> 4 lead acid batteries<br /> 5 speakers (various sizes)<br /> 2 hydraulic lifts<br /> 3 small electric motors<br /> 4 medium electric motors<br />22 assorted toggle switches<br />32 cots/mattresses<br /> 1 retro encabulator <br /> <br /> 7 buckets<br /> 4 spigots<br />17 assorted momentary<br />   switches<br /> 3 pressure meters<br /> 1 cutting torch<br />4 acetylene canisters<br />10 oxygen tanks<br /></span><span class="d" i="2">(заниматься бессмысленным делом)</span><span class="d" i="3">188 welding rods<br />  1 engine room door<br />  1 electric welder<br /> 3 soldering irons<br />20 assorted solenoids<br /> 4 flow regulators<br /> 7 assorted voltmeters<br /> 2 oscilloscopes<br />22 torpedo warhead explosives<br /> 5 wire bundles and harness <br />    (50 feet)<br />  1 multimeter<br />  1 fuel hose (50 feet)<br />  8 assorted fans<br />  4 large pipe wrenches<br /> 12 cases of Żubrówka<br /> 11 assorted pumps<br />  1 electric hoist<br />  2 come-alongs<br />  1 cable winch<br /> 41 assorted light bulbs<br />  2 refrigerators<br />40 large cans assorted vegetables<br />  2 electric ovens</span></p><p i="85" name="SeedInformation" child="13"><span class="d" i="0">    Seed<br />Information</span><span class="d" i="1"><img src="/../Global/SeedInformation.png" /></span><span class="d" i="2">Ambassador Seeds</span><span class="d" i="3">Ambassador Seeds were first documented about 150 Earth years ago. They occur about once every 400 days if the trees remain healthy. Natural seed swaps occur between pairs of seeds that (we now know) dropped simultaneously from healthy trees in paired sphere. When each seed was touched by species in sphere the swap occurred - sending an "ambassador" from each sphere to the paired sphere. </span><span class="d" i="4">Location of the swap is defined by the locations of the pairs of seeds. After the first swap the seeds recharged quickly - allowing for a quick return. "First meetings" were intense but naturally short (it was quite a surprise for both the Mofang and us.) Over time the seeds required more time to recharge - producing longer visits between species.</span><span class="d" i="5">Collector Seeds</span><span class="d" i="6">Everyone who arrives is familiar with the Collector Seeds. The bright light that we were all drawn to right before the event that brought us here is a Collector Seed. What new arrivers may not be aware of is that these seeds (like all seeds) come in pairs. When the Tree drops a Collector Seed on the ground it signals that its twin has begun its quest for a new being. That search may take hours or it may take years. When an appropriate situation (unnatural threat of death?) is found, the seed activates and swaps a smaller (but varying sized) sphere from Earth (or whatever appropriate home world) here to Hunrath. </span><span class="d" i="7">As Hunrath became more populated we would watch for a newly dropped Collector Seed, collect it, and place it in the entry canyon area. This allowed us to provide a more predictable entry experience for new arrivers, and provide a single area to collect any resources that may have come along with the new arriver.<br /></span><span class="d" i="8">Unlike Ambassador Seeds (and Mother Seeds?), Collector Seeds do not seem to survive -- the inner core is spent, leaving only the lifeless outer husk.<br /></span><span class="d" i="9">Mother Seeds</span><span class="d" i="10">(Postulated but unverified) First suggested by Alima Hamsa (2232BH), the notion of Mother Seeds extrapolates the behavior of the lesser seeds to a super-seed. She posited that the process that actually "created" the paired spheres was similar to all other swaps, but on a much grander scale. </span><span class="d" i="11">The idea is that two seeds (from a Mother tree?) were scattered on the "galactic winds" to "find" appropriately similar environments. When matches were found, some process was triggered that swapped large portions of landscape between vastly different worlds. Alima further noted that the Trees' locations in the center of the spheres suggested that the Trees grew from these Mother seeds. </span><span class="d" i="12">Because of the similarities, it has been conjectured that re-swapping the entire environmental spheres might be possible with a larger scale version of the Ambassador Seed machine.<br /></span></p><p i="86" name="TheGauntlet" child="2"><span class="d" i="0"><br />Hello Oleg, <br /> <br />The Gauntlet area is complex -- it was meant to be.
